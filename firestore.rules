/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SanteConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data
 * (users, appointments, emergency contacts, medications) and restricts administrative
 * functions (medical professionals, holistic content) to authorized admins.
 * Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Appointments for a specific user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /users/{userId}/emergencyContacts/{contactId}: Emergency contacts for a specific user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /users/{userId}/medications/{medicationId}: Medications for a specific user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /users/{userId}/prescriptions/{prescriptionId}: Prescriptions for a specific user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /medicalProfessionals/{medicalProfessionalId}: Medical professional profiles, manageable only by admins.
 * - /holisticContent/{holisticContentId}: Holistic wellness content, manageable only by admins.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Admin role assignments. The existence of a document at this path grants admin privileges to the user.
 * - /forumThreads/{threadId}: Publicly readable forum threads. Authenticated users can create/delete their own.
 * - /forumThreads/{threadId}/posts/{postId}: Publicly readable replies. Authenticated users can create/delete their own.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private; listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Admin privileges are granted based on the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 * - No custom claims are used.
 * - Data shape validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping. Only critical authorization fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User ownership is enforced through path-based matching (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
 * - Admin status is determined by the presence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored in user-specific subcollections to prevent accidental public exposure.
